# 201909_202109_Transactions_Review
A review of all the purchases I made from Sep 2019-Sep2021

## Excel Cleaning
- cleaned the csv files on excel of information like location and instead replaced it with the names of companies who issued the transaction.
- renamed the categories of both csv files to match so grouping them would be easier
- checked through purchases and changed categories depending on whether or not I thought I was in the purchase was in the right category
